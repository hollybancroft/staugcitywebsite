<p> St. Augustine was transformed into a winter vacation destination by Henry Flagler two decades after the Civil War. Flagler connected St. Augustine to the rest of the east coast by railway, and reconstructed St. Augustine with it's now iconic architectural style. He also built three famous hotels, one of which was transformed into what is now Flagler college.</p>
